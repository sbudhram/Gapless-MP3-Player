IMPORTANT FORK NOTE:
==================
This version is forked from emotionray's version.  In a nutshell, it works the same, but there are a number of
internal structural changes aimed at simplifying the code and taking advantage of Objective C's newest compiler
constructs.

This version also adds support for seeking to a specific location for any file in the queue.
